                  <ul>
                    <li>Security fix: in previous releases, when opening a session with a configured SSH gateway (jump host), the gateway connection was bound to any local network adapters. This has been changed in current version by only binding SSH gateway connections to loopback network interface. Thanks to thomas (at) bleier.at for reporting this issue.</li>
                    <li>New feature: added basic syntax coloration (right-click on the terminal and choose "Syntax highlighting" sub-menu). Currently 3 syntax types are available: keywords, shell script and Cisco (network configuration)</li>

                    <li>Bugfix: bookmarks from the top menu were not ordered and started properly in a border case related to using special characters in sessions</li>
                    <li>Bugfix: when saving terminal output to RTF file, text font in the RTF file is set to "Courier New" for proper fixed-width text rendering</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>New feature: added "SCP" protocol for the graphical SSH-browser: MobaXterm can now use SCP in order to browse your remote server content. This experimental feature can be activated from your SSH session settings.</li>
                    <li>Improvement: accelerated terminal display even in TrueColors mode</li>
                    <li>Improvement: with SCP protocol, SSH-browser does not open a new SSH connection anymore, but makes use of the existing terminal connection instead (SSH multiplexing)</li>
                    <li>Improvement: with SCP protocol, SSH-browser is not "connected" anymore and thus it stays alive as long as the terminal SSH connection is enabled</li>
                    <li>Improvement: greatly improved SSH-browser transfer speed when using the new SCP protocol</li>

                  <p class="version_titre">Version 4.5 (2012-05-02)</p>          
                  <ul>    
                    <li>New feature added: you can now "detach" any MobaXterm tab to an independant window. This window can be "pinned" in order to stay always on top of all other windows or to be displayed in "real" fullscreen (without displaying the task bar or title bar)</li>                                                   
                    <li>Improved startup speed when using plugins: first time you start MobaXterm, a plugin index is created (file "MobaXterm.idx"). This speeds up MobaXterm plugins enumeration at startup</li>
                    <li>You can now open an X11 tab. This allows X11 windows to be displayed into a single MobaXterm tab instead of being displayed outside MobaXterm, thanks to the powerful DWM window manager. This is also a replacement for the old Openbox feature that had disapeared since v4.0</li>
                    <li>XDMCP sessions are now displayed into a MobaXterm tab: XDMCP windows are now managed as a standard MobaXterm tab. If you want to display your Xdmcp sessions outside MobaXterm, you can still "detach" the corresponding tab</li>
                    <li>New session settings for starting in normal tab, detached tab, maximized detached tab or fullscreen</li>
                    <li>RDP features have been added such as full NLA protocol compliance, an improved toolbar and a new fullscreen mode</li>
                    <li>Added tab title "hints" displayed when mouse goes over a tab whose name is truncated</li>
                    <li>Corrected a bug when switching to "no skin" mode: in some cases, the new skin setting was not correctly saved</li>
                    <li>Corrected a bug with the "chmod" and "chown" commands not setting file access permissions correctly. This also solves an old bug with "ls -al" not displaying the correct permissions on some filesystems.</li>
                    <li>Corrected a RDP focus bug</li>
                    <li>Added basic SSH command completion (based on known hosts and users list)</li>
                    <li>New setting for saving passwords to MobaXterm ini file and transfer previously saved passwords to the INI file (useful for transferring passwords from a computer to another)</li>
                    <li>Corrected bugs when connecting to switch and router equipments using SSH</li>
                    <li>Corrected a bug with terminal that did not render fonts correctly in some special cases and displayed only pink wide lines with nothing else written (this one was hard to find...)</li>
                    <li>Improved fonts detection and choice: now the default MobaXterm font is not unpacked anymore before use, it is mapped in memory</li>
                    <li>The X11 server now shows its DISPLAY as a small hint when you put the mouse cursor over the green "X" button</li>
                    <li>Corrected a "File access denied" message that was displayed at MobaXterm startup when MobaXterm was previously started with admin priviledges</li>
                    <li>Corrected a bug that occured at MobaXterm startup, when program was updated from a version older than v3.2</li>
                    <li>Terminal logging can now be configured per session</li>
                    <li>New keyboard shortcut for cycling through tabs (Ctrl+TAB by default)</li>
                    <li>New "Duplicate tab" option</li>
                    <li>Added a new command line option "-exec" for executing a command into MobaXterm bash shell (you can call for instance MobaXterm.exe -exec "date; sleep 1; echo 'This is a test'; echo 'Press any key to exit MobaXterm'; read i")</li>
                    <li>PRO EDITION ONLY: Added a new button for showing stored passwords</li>
                    <li>PRO EDITION ONLY: Added a new button for exporting stored passwords to a text file</li>

                    <li>Added a new option for working with SSH gateway server (use an intermediate SSH server in order to reach the desired server)</li>

                    <li>Improved RDP automatic password saving that did not work with very slow connections</li>
                    <li>Improved RDP console connections detection on XP SP3 and higher (switched to the "ConnectToAdministerServer" RDP option instead of "ConnectToServerConsole")</li>
                    <li>Corrected a bug: when one changed the name of a tab and pressed ENTER, the tab name was effectively changed but the active terminal also interpreted the ENTER command</li>
                    <li>New commands: "ssh-copy-id" (copy your SSH public keys to remote servers for passwordless authentication) and "Rainbowizer"</li>
                    <li>MobaXterm is now fully compatible with Windows 8 Consumer Preview</li>
